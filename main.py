Possible class ideas:
class Question (create an instance of this class each time you want to show a question)
- Will contain correct answer, wrong answer as an attribute
- Attributes taken from connecting to the SQL server
- Can use permutations itertool in a method to select how it will be displayed?

class Player (create an instance of this class for each user)
- Attributes (private ones probably) will include username, password, score history
- Can login, delete player, show previous scores etc...

class Test (create an instance every time you start a new test)
- Brings up options to select difficulty of questions you want
- Calculates total score from no. of questions you get right?
- in main, create instance of test, then instances of questions
